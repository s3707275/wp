                        <td>I do not have a lot of programming experience. I only started coding at the beginning of the year. In semester one of my Computer Science degree, I completed 'Programming Techniques' so have a understanding of Javascript. I haven't worked with any other programming language, or in any web development. As far as designing goes, I took 'User Centred Design' last semseter as well. In this, we were taught many different design principles which we implemented while trying to create application prototypes.</td>

                        <td>I tend to see myself as more of a programmer. It has been what I've enjoyed most since starting this course. I enjoy the logic to it, and while it may have caused me to want to tear out chunks of my hair at times, ulitimately, I enjoy the challenge of it. That said, I do enjoy the freedom of design and find it relaxing. I thoroughly enjoyed working with the design programs Sketch and Invision, to develop iOS app prototypes.</td>

Outside of that, I like all things outdoors, hiking, snowboarding and surfing being towards the top of that list. When I'm not on my feet, you'll often find me binge watching anything on Netflix or playing video games. Plus dogs are pretty great too.</td>
